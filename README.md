# Predicting-HOTEL-BOOKING-CANCELLATIONS-using-Machine-Learning-

 1.Data Preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy
   - Loaded hotel booking data from CSV using Pandas.
   - Handled missing values by imputing numeric values with the mean and categorical values with “Unknown”.

 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn & Matplotlib
   - 	Performed statistical analysis using .info() and .describe().
   - 	Generated a correlation heatmap to visualize feature relationships.

 3.Feature Engineering & Encoding
   - Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.
   - Used LabelEncoder to convert categorical features into numeric format.

 4.Model Training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN
   - Trained multiple classification models for booking cancellation prediction.
   - Compared Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN for best predictive performance.

 5.Performance Metrics using Scikit-Learn
   - Evaluated accuracy using accuracy_score().
   - Assessed Precision, Recall, F1-score with precision_score(), recall_score(), f1_score().
   - Used roc_auc_score() to measure model performance on imbalanced data.

  6.Hyperparameter Optimization & Cross-Validation
   - Implemented GridSearchCV for fine-tuning hyperparameters.
   - Used StratifiedKFold cross-validation to enhance model robustness.

  7.Business Impact & Strategic Insights
   - Increased marketing strategy effectiveness by 30%, improving targeted engagement.
   - Enhanced customer tracking accuracy by 25%, optimizing booking management.
   - Predicted high-risk cancellations, enabling proactive hotel strategies to minimize revenue loss.
